# Attrition Game Analysis & Website Strategy

## Part 1: Game Deep Dive

### What Attrition Actually Is

**Attrition** is a **deep, tech-tree driven space empire strategy game** with:

#### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Establish colonies** across star systems with coordinates (A00:00:12:11 format)
2. **Build infrastructure** (energy plants, research labs, shipyards, defensive structures)
3. **Research technologies** to unlock better buildings, units, and weapons
4. **Build fleets** with specialized ships for different purposes
5. **Engage in combat**, diplomacy, and territorial conquest
6. **Manage resources**: Credits (economy) and Energy (operations)

#### Economic System
- **Credits**: Produced hourly from infrastructure (Metal Processing, Economic Centers, Capital buildings)
- **Energy**: Generated by energy plants, consumed by buildings and fleets
- **Energy Budget**: Net energy balance determines operational capacity
- Tech progression unlocks better income sources (Metal Processing → Nanite Factories → Economic Centers)

#### Technology Tree (17 tech branches)
- **Energy**: Increases base energy output by 5% per level (foundational)
- **Computer**: 1 campaign fleet per level
- **Armour**: +5% unit/defense armour
- **Laser/Missiles/Plasma/Ion/Photon/Disruptor**: Weapon tech lines
- **Stellar Drive/Warp Drive**: Movement tech (unlock faster ships)
- **Shielding**: Shields for units and defenses
- **Stealth**: Fleet detection reduction
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Unlocks Android Factories
- **Cybernetics**: Orbital Shipyards
- **Tachyon Communications**: Capital building
- **Anti-Gravity**: (advanced tech)

**Key insight**: Tech prerequisites gate content. Must research Laser 4 before Plasma. All progression is skill-gated by tech trees.

#### Buildings (30+ types)

**Energy Production**:
- Solar/Gas Plants → Fusion → Antimatter → Orbital Plants
- Each requires energy tech prerequisites

**Economy**:
- Metal Processing (1 credit/hr)
- Robotic Factories (1 credit/hr)
- Spaceports (2 credits/hr)
- Economic Centers (3 credits/hr)
- Capital (10 credits/hr, requires Tachyon Communications 1)

**Military/Strategic**:
- Shipyards (ground-based, basic ships)
- Orbital Shipyards (advanced ships, requires Cybernetics 2)
- Command Centers (fleet command)
- Research Labs (tech research)
- Jump Gates (fast travel between systems, requires Warp Drive 12)

**Advanced**:
- Nanite Factories (requires Computer 10 + Laser 8)
- Android Factories (requires AI 4)
- Biosphere Modification (requires Computer 24 + Energy 24)
- Multi-Level Platforms (requires Armour 22)

#### Units (20 ship types)

**Progression Hierarchy**:
1. **Fighters/Bombers** (5-60 credits, entry-level)
2. **Stellar Drives** (Corvette, Destroyer, Frigate) - 20-80 credits, fast regional ships
3. **Warp Ships** (Scout, Cruiser, Carrier) - 40-400 credits, long-range
4. **Capital Ships** (Battleship, Dreadnought) - 2000-10000 credits, major investments
5. **Megaships** (Titan, Leviathan, Death Star) - 50k-500k credits, game-ending threats

**Weapon Types**:
- Laser → Plasma → Ion → Photon → Disruptor (escalating power)
- Each weapon has % effectiveness vs shields

**Special Mechanics**:
- Hangar capacity (Carriers: 80-4000 spaces, Fighters consume -1 space)
- Recyclers collect debris for credits
- Fleet speed tied to ship drive types
- Leviathan: +5% power/armour to fleet
- Death Star: +10% power/armour to fleet, can't use jump gates

#### Defenses (10 types)
- Barracks → Laser → Missile → Plasma → Ion → Photon → Disruptor Turrets
- Shield Systems: Deflection Shields, Planetary Shield
- Planetary Ring (advanced defense, requires Photon 10)

#### Strategic Depth
- **Energy management** forces build tradeoffs
- **Tech prerequisites** create progression gates
- **Fleet composition** matters (hangar space, weapon effectiveness)
- **Territory control** via colonization and defense
- **Economies of scale** (Capital building worth 10 structures)
- **Multiplayer conflict** - alliances, treaties, wars

## Part 2: Current Website Problems

### What's Wrong
1. **Generic boilerplate** - could describe any space MMO
2. **10,000+ star systems** misleading (no gameplay depth mentioned)
3. **500+ ship types** wrong (only 20)
4. **No mention of core loop**: build → research → craft → battle
5. **No tech tree explanation** (the real game)
6. **No resource management strategy** (energy/credits)
7. **No unit progression or combat mechanics**
8. **Empty footer** with no real contact info
9. **Doesn't explain what makes Attrition unique**
10. **No SEO keywords** for "space strategy game", "tech tree MMO", "4X game", etc.
